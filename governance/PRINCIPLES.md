# Principles

These principles govern the company-level career system used to manage resumes, job search execution, and portfolio signaling across multiple people.

---

## P1. Human truth is authoritative

- The person’s `RESUME_MASTER.md` (in a person-level repo) is the source of truth.
- Generated outputs and shared exports are not authoritative.

(See ADR-001.)

---

## P2. Lane coherence beats “everything résumé”

- A resume must present one coherent professional identity.
- Variants exist to align signals with target roles.

(See ADR-002.)

---

## P3. AI is leverage, not authority

- AI can propose phrasing, structure, and keyword improvements.
- AI must not introduce facts or silently change truth.

(See ADR-003.)

---

## P4. Execution outcomes matter more than tooling polish

- Career execution (applications, outreach, interviews) is the primary loop.
- Tooling is justified only when it reduces friction or improves outcomes.

(See ADR-004.)

---

## P5. Privacy and defensibility are non-negotiable

- Do not publish sensitive personal information.
- Do not publish confidential employer details.
- Every claim must be defensible in conversation.

(See ADR-005 and ADR-006.)

---

## P6. Decisions are logged

- When a choice changes how the system works, record an ADR.
- Do not rewrite history; supersede with a new ADR.

---

## P7. Keep the system lightweight

- Prefer checklists and templates over heavy process.
- Promote to CANON only after real use and review.

---

## P8. Multi-person scaling requires isolation

- Share structure, templates, and playbooks.
- Do not mix individual achievements across people.

(See ADR-005.)
