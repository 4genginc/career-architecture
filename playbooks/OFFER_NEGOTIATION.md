# Offer Negotiation

This playbook defines a simple, defensible negotiation process.

Goal: protect downside risk and improve upside without damaging trust.

---

## Inputs

- written offer details (title, level, base, bonus, equity, benefits)
- start date and location/remote policy
- competing offers (if any)
- your constraints (minimum acceptable, schedule, commute, visa/work auth, etc.)
- the lane you are being hired into

---

## Outputs

- a clear “accept / counter / decline” decision
- a one-page negotiation plan
- a script for recruiter conversation
- a follow-up email

---

## Step 1 — Clarify the full package

Before negotiating, confirm you have:

- base salary
- bonus (sign-on and annual)
- equity (if any) + vesting schedule
- benefits (health, retirement match)
- PTO and holidays
- on-call expectations
- relocation (if needed)
- start date flexibility

If any are missing, ask for clarification first.

---

## Step 2 — Decide your walk-away numbers

Define:

- **Target** (ideal)
- **Acceptable** (good enough)
- **Walk-away** (not acceptable)

Write them down privately.

---

## Step 3 — Choose negotiation levers

Common levers:

- base salary
- sign-on bonus
- annual bonus target
- equity amount
- title/level alignment
- remote/hybrid flexibility
- start date
- PTO
- education budget

Pick **1–3 levers** max. Too many looks unfocused.

---

## Step 4 — Build your justification

Use role-aligned reasons:

- scope of responsibilities
- required skills and scarcity
- comparable market range (lightly referenced)
- your track record and lane fit

Avoid:

- emotional arguments
- threats
- long explanations

Keep it professional and concrete.

---

## Step 5 — Counter strategy

### Best practice

- Express excitement.
- Ask if there is flexibility.
- Present a specific counter.
- Pause and let them respond.

### Counter shape

- One clear number (base)
- One optional add-on (sign-on or PTO)

Example framing:

- “I’m excited about the role. Based on scope and my background, is there flexibility to bring the base to $X? If that’s difficult, could we consider a $Y sign-on bonus?”

---

## Step 6 — Recruiter call script (short)

1. Appreciation + excitement
2. Confirm you understand the offer
3. Ask about flexibility
4. Make the ask
5. Agree on next step and timeline

---

## Step 7 — Follow-up email

After the call:

- summarize what was discussed
- restate your ask
- confirm timeline

Use templates in `templates/OUTREACH_EMAIL_TEMPLATES.md` (negotiation section).

---

## Step 8 — Decide and close

If improved offer meets acceptable threshold:

- accept promptly and professionally

If not:

- either accept anyway (if still above walk-away)
- or decline with respect

Record outcome and learnings in `career-ops-private/logs/weekly/YYYY-W##.md`.

---

## Guardrails

- Never bluff offers you don’t have.
- Never over-share personal financial details.
- Stay consistent with your lane identity.
- Don’t negotiate if you are not prepared to accept.
