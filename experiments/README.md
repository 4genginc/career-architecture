# Experiments

This folder holds controlled tests used to improve resume performance, ATS match, outreach response rates, and overall execution outcomes.

Experiments exist to prevent “random tweaking” from becoming permanent system behavior.

---

## What belongs here

- A/B tests of resume variants
- keyword set changes and ATS deltas
- LinkedIn headline/about experiments
- outreach message experiments
- portfolio ordering experiments

If an idea is not yet proven, it belongs here—not in CANON.

## Canon promotion rule

An experiment may be promoted to stable practice when:

1. it was executed in real applications/outreach,
2. results were reviewed (weekly review),
3. the change is documented (what changed and why), and
4. if it changes system behavior, an ADR is added.
