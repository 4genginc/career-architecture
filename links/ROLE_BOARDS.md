# Role Boards

This file lists the job boards and sourcing channels you use, plus how you use them.

**Rules**
- Fewer sources, used consistently, beats many sources used randomly.
- Save searches and alerts by **lane**.
- Track what works in `logs/weekly/`.

---

## 1) Primary boards (general)

- Setup:
  - saved searches per lane

## 2) Tech-focused boards

### Hacker News — “Who is hiring?”

---

## 3) Company-direct sourcing
- Company career pages (Tier 1 list)
- “Open roles” pages for target teams

**Rule:** if a company is Tier 1, treat its career page as a primary board.

---

## 4) Recruiter channels
- Inbound recruiters (LinkedIn)
- Specialist recruiters (lane-specific)

Log meaningful recruiter threads in:
- `logs/conversations/informational_interviews.md` (or split later)

---

## 5) Saved searches (templates)
Create 3–5 saved searches per lane.

### Lane A — Linux Backend / Systems
- `linux backend engineer`
- `systems engineer linux`
- `c++ linux networking`
- `site reliability engineer linux` (only if relevant)

### Lane B — Embedded / RF / Electronics
- `embedded software engineer c++`
- `device driver engineer linux`
- `rf engineer embedded`
- `sdr engineer` (niche)

### Lane C — AI Systems / RAG / Agents
- `llm engineer rag`
- `ai platform engineer retrieval`
- `ml engineer systems` (only if aligned)

---

## 6) Weekly operating rule
Each week:
- Pick 2 boards as primary for active scanning.
- Spend a fixed time block (e.g., 2–3 sessions/week).
- Log counts and outcomes in `logs/weekly/YYYY-WW.md`.

## 7) Board performance log (optional)
| Week | Board | Time spent | Leads found | Applications | Interviews | Notes |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
