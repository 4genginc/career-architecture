# Role Boards

This document lists sourcing channels (job boards, company pages, recruiter channels) and how to use them consistently.

---

## Rules

* **Consistency beats breadth:** a few sources used weekly beats many sources used randomly.
* **Lane-first:** save searches and alerts by lane.
* **Track outcomes weekly:** record what worked in `career-ops-private/logs/weekly/YYYY-W##.md`.
* **Privacy:** do not log sensitive personal data or private employer information in any public repo.

---

## 1) Primary boards (general)

### LinkedIn Jobs

* Use for: discovery + recruiter visibility
* Setup:

  * saved searches per lane
  * alerts (daily)
  * filters: level, location, remote/hybrid

### Indeed

* Use for: broad coverage (including non-tech and hybrid roles)
* Setup:

  * saved searches + email alerts

### Glassdoor

* Use for: salary signals + company review context
* Setup:

  * saved searches (optional)

### Google Jobs (search)

* Use for: quick cross-board scan
* Query patterns:

  * `<role> <city> remote`
  * `<company> careers <role>`

---

## 2) Tech-focused boards

### Wellfound (AngelList)

* Use for: startups

### Built In / Hired (varies by region)

* Use for: curated listings

### Hacker News — “Who is hiring?”

* Use for: monthly batch scan
* Workflow:

  * search within the post for your lane keywords
  * capture leads in the weekly log

---

## 3) Company-direct sourcing

* Company career pages (Tier 1 list)
* “Open roles” pages for target teams

**Rule:** if a company is Tier 1, treat its career page as a primary board.

---

## 4) Recruiter channels

* Inbound recruiters (LinkedIn)
* Specialist recruiters (lane-specific)

Log meaningful recruiter threads and informational chats in the private repo:

* `career-ops-private/logs/conversations/`

  * Suggested split:

    * `informational_interviews.md`
    * `recruiter_threads.md`

---

## 5) Saved searches (templates)

Create **3–5 saved searches per lane**. Keep them broad enough to repeat weekly.

### Lane A — Linux Backend / Systems

* `linux backend engineer`
* `systems engineer linux`
* `c++ linux networking`
* `site reliability engineer linux` (only if relevant)

### Lane B — Embedded / RF / Electronics

* `embedded software engineer c++`
* `device driver engineer linux`
* `rf engineer embedded`
* `sdr engineer` (niche)

### Lane C — AI Systems / RAG / Agents

* `llm engineer rag`
* `ai platform engineer retrieval`
* `ml engineer systems` (only if aligned)

---

## 6) Weekly operating rule

Each week:

* Pick **2 boards** as primary for active scanning.
* Spend a fixed time block (e.g., **2–3 sessions/week**).
* Log counts and outcomes in `career-ops-private/logs/weekly/YYYY-W##.md`.

## 7) Board performance log (optional)

| Week | Board | Time spent | Leads found | Applications | Interviews | Notes |
| ---- | ----- | ---------: | ----------: | -----------: | ---------: | ----- |
|      |       |            |             |              |            |       |
