# Target Companies

This file is the working list of companies to prioritize for outreach and applications.

**Rules**
- Keep this list aligned to your current **lane** (ADR-002).
- Prefer companies where your experience is obviously legible (low translation cost).
- Keep notes factual (avoid emotional language; avoid speculation).

---

## 1) How to use this list
1. Add companies as you discover them.
2. Weekly: pick **5–10** from Tier 1–2 to actively pursue.
3. For each company you actively pursue, create a role scorecard (or log in weekly).

---

## 2) Company tiers
- **Tier 1:** High fit + high signal + realistic path (referral possible, roles appear regularly).
- **Tier 2:** Good fit + realistic, but lower signal or less frequent hiring.
- **Tier 3:** Opportunistic (apply only when the JD is unusually aligned).

---

## 3) Target table (copy/paste rows)
| Company | Tier | Lane | Location | Target teams / keywords | Why it fits | Entry path | Status | Next action | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  | Watch |  |  |

**Fields**
- **Lane:** Linux Backend / Embedded-RF / AI Systems (choose one)
- **Entry path:** Referral / Recruiter / Cold outreach / Job board
- **Status:** Watch / Active / Applied / Interviewing / Closed

## 4) Shortlists (optional)
Use these sections when you want a smaller “current cycle” list.

### Tier 1 (current cycle)
-

### Tier 2 (current cycle)
-

### Tier 3 (opportunistic)
-

---

## 5) Notes to capture (what matters)
- Hiring pattern (steady vs bursty)
- Team adjacency to your strengths (Linux, C/C++, networking, embedded, RF, etc.)
- Practical constraints (onsite requirements, clearance-only roles, etc.)
- Who to contact (names live in private notes if needed)
