# Role Scorecard Template

Use this scorecard to evaluate a role consistently and decide whether to **Apply**, **Outreach-first**, or **Skip**.

Keep it fast: 10–15 minutes.

## Role

- **Company:**
- **Role title:**
- **Level:**
- **Location / remote:**
- **Comp range (if known):**
- **Source link:**
- **Date triaged:**
- **Lane:** (Backend / Embedded / AI Platform / UIUX / Other)

## 1) Hard constraints (Pass/Fail)

Mark **Fail** if any non-negotiable constraint is violated.

- Location/commute: Pass / Fail
- Schedule/shift: Pass / Fail
- Work authorization: Pass / Fail
- Safety / physical requirements: Pass / Fail
- Credential requirements: Pass / Fail

**If any Fail → decision is Skip** (unless there is a clear exception).
