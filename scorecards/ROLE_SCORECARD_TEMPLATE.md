## 2) Must-have coverage (0–5)

List top 5 must-haves from the JD:

1.
2.
3.
4.
5.

Coverage score guidance:

**Score:** __ / 5

## 6) Decision

Choose one:

* **Apply** (High / Medium / Low)
* **Outreach-first**
* **Skip**

Suggested rule-of-thumb:

* **Apply (High):** constraints pass; coverage ≥ 4; signal ≥ 7
* **Outreach-first:** constraints pass; role is good but needs a warm path or clarity
* **Skip:** any constraint fail, or coverage ≤ 2 and no strong network angle

**Reason (2–4 bullets):**
